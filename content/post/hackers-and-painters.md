A previous article and book detailed the similarities of hackers and painters[^1] and how the comparison can be used to elucidate important aspects of being successful in business. Like the author, I also consider myself both a hacker[^2] and a painter[^3] and have been thinking a lot about their similarities, and differences.

Hacking and painting are both hobbies for me. I write programs for myself, to make things easier or just because they are fun to write. Few of these programs are *useful*[^5]. More often I write *useless* programs, like a program to determine if random squiggles generate random numbers[^6]. I started painting and coding about fifteen years ago[^4] for my own enjoyment. Along the way, though I've found some interesting comparisons between design, development, and reception of both paintings and programs.

There are many similarities between hacking and painting. Actually, I find the similarities are little boring because a similarity means that there is no real reason to take up both hacking and painting because you could theoretically derive the useful characteristics by just taking up just one.
As addressed in *Hackers & Painters*, I also find that both hackers and painters use past references (museums for painters, open-source for hackers) to learn from. Also, both hacking and painting require learning by doing, rather than by reading. Both require building on what you've done previously, although I don't think this is specific to just painting and programming. Both also generally requiring development through gradual refinement and both products (art or code).

The differences between hacking and painting are a lot more exciting, as they reveal the potential benefits of one activity versus the other, as well as where trouble lies. One difference I find, is who the audience is. In both cases, the audience is human, but the number of humans makes a difference. In painting, the audience is often a single person. The majority of paintings in the world do not hang in museums, so they are not viewed by patrons or visitors - the majority of paintings hang in homes and are placed their by only a single person who thought it was beautiful enough to purchase (or create). In hacking, the audience is anyone who can download your code which, thanks to Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket, can be hundreds and thousands of people. This difference becomes a problem for the public perception of programmers. When I tell someone I'm coding a silly program, like writing a program to use squiggles to validate random numbers, I often get a reaction like *Why would you do that?* Alternatively, if I tell someone I'm going to paint a silly picture, like a bunch of squiggles, the reaction is more like *Cool, very avante-garde.* It seems to me that painters, and not programmers, have the benefit of having their motivation be always sacrosanct from public perception.

Another big difference is that, in painting, the proof is in the eating of the pudding. Whereas, in programming, even though a program works and does what is is designed to do, etc. it will be criticized if the source-code is written in a "non-idiomatic" style.[^7] For some reason, in programming, the proof is not only in the eating of the pudding but also the steps leading up to the creation of the pudding. Similarly, programming, moreso than painting, can be criticized for leaving out arbitrary features. Ironically, paintings that are missing features are just classified as another type of painting.

These two differences yield a slightly sour result in terms of reception by an audience.

Differences (my own ideas):

- in painting the proof is in the eating of the pudding (wheras programming, people will critizize the executation as "non-idiomatic")
- in painting, a lot of mistakes breed wonderful attributes. In programming, mistakes breed worse mistakes
- in painting a sublte gesture makes a big difference
