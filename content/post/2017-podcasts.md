## Podcasts about Small Things

My favorite podcast of 2017 is a generic theme of podcast which I will just call, *The Podcast of Small Things*. The basic premise is always to find some small thing that no one thinks about and talk about it for 20-30 minutes and often interview the main players involved in the production of the Small Thing. I think the major bastion of this type of podcast is **[99% invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/)**, which is devoted to illuminating *"all the thought that goes into the things we donâ€™t think about."*

There is now a cottage industry for these types of podcasts, and I love them all. There is also **[Every Little Thing](https://gimletmedia.com/every-little-thing/)** which is *"a show about the small stuff."* Then there is **[Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/about)** which is Malcom Gladwell's show about *"Something overlooked. Something misunderstood."* but mostly its just small things that Mr. Gladwell finds fascinating. There is **[Undiscovered](http://www.undiscoveredpodcast.org/)** which is a podcast *"about the all the stuff that gets left out of journal articles,"* and while nominally science-based it often overturns the small things. There is also **[Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org/)** which is more sound-based but still aims to fill the divide because *"you may not think about the sounds you hear every day."* Though its not their mission statement, I would also add **[Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/)** to this list because they often diverge from talking finance to talking about [spies](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/30/547411440/episode-791-tips-from-spies), [weird people that like breaking records](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/30/547411440/episode-791-tips-from-spies), or [how robocalls work](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/18/544448670/episode-789-robocall-invasion).

## News at a bar

My other favorite podcasts are the news ones that are toned as if you were having a beer with the podcasters. They still relay information, but in a way that is so informal you barely realize that they are relaying some information that they spent their week learning. For politics, there is **[NPR politics](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast)** and often (nowadays) **[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast)**, for art there is **[A Piece of Work](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3860)**, for science there is **[Science Vs.](https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/)**, and for music there is **[All Songs Considered](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered)** and for culture there is **[Pop Culture Happy Hour](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour/)**. I love these podcasts, but I have to pace myself with them because the constant loose informality of the tone can become disingenuous and grating after awhile.


## Guilty pleasure listening

I have some favorite podcasts that are just funny or amusing to me, and not entirely educational. These would include **[Why oh why](http://www.whyohwhyradio.com/)** which accounts for dating in the real world (though sometimes fictionally). Then there is just the improve humor of **[My Brother My Brother and Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me)** which I enjoy just to hear people crack themselves up.
