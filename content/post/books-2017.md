I've read about 15 books this year, not as many as I usually do and not as many as I'd like to. Although I've been reading a lot of the *New Yorker* which takes up quite a bit of my reading time.

**Illumination in the Flatwoods** by *Joe Hutto* is my favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.

**Library at Mount Char** by *Scott Hawkins* is my second-favorite book of 2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to science fiction.

**Last Chance to See** by *Douglas Adams* is an interesting investigation of animals near extinction, circa 1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and entertaining book.

**Imaginary Imagnitude** by *Stainslaw Lem* is a wholly amazing book - from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is still funny nevertheless.

**Weaveworld** by *Clive Barker* is an epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they merge at the end. Great read.

**Gonzo Girl** by *Cheryl Della Pietra* is an extraordinary fictional account of an assistant to Hunter Thompson. A lot of it dwelves into tropes about genius (drug addition = create genius??) and sexism (which the author herself constantly proclaims and then falls right into). Still, the writing is very good.

**Calculating God** by *Robert J. Sawyer* is a fun *fictional* book with some interesting ideas about other worlds having simultaneous mass extinctions. I've never read a book which addresses the search for G-d in such a scientific way, which is really the best way to go for it.

Other books I've read that I thought were good (since I read through them):

- **Hard Magic** by *Larry Correia*
- **Death Comes for the Archbishop** by *Willa Cather*
- **Everyone's An Aliebn when you're an Aliebn Too** by *Jomny Sun* 
- **Jack Reacher 61 hours** by *Lee Child*
- **True Grit** by *Charles Portis*
- **Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo** by *Obert Skye*
- **Pieces of the Left Hand** by *J. Robert Lennon*
- **American Bison** by *Steven Rinella*
