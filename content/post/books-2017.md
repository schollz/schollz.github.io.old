**Illumination in the Flatwoods** by *Joe Hutto*

My favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.

**Library at Mount Char** by *Scott Hawkins*

My second-favorite book of 2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to science fiction.

**Last Chance to See** by *Douglas Adams*. 

An interesting investigation of animals near extinction, circa 1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and entertaining book.

**Imaginary Imagnitude** by *Stainslaw Lem*

A wholly amazing book - from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is still funny nevertheless.

**Weaveworld** by *Clive Barker*

An epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they merge at the end. Great read.
