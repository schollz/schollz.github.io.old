Our mission is similar to [The Sun's Reader's Write], [Brevity
Magazine], [Creative Nonfiction Magazine], [100 Word Stories], [1966
Journal], [Concis], [Proximity Magazine], [Spartan Literature], and
[Thread Literary]. However, unlike these magazines, we are devoted to
publishing great *anonymous* nonfiction where great writing can take
place despite the name of the person who writes it.
