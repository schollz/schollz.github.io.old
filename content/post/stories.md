Sarcasm is the native language of the Internet. Unfortunately, since sarcasm is a close friend to cynicism, this can make the Internet a negative and disillusioned place. I decided to make an effort to make a place on the Internet that is more positive and reflective. This place would be where you can present your own story, anonymously and sincerely. The result was initially called "Stories, Incognito" but I later decided on the name "*anonfiction*" (i.e. anonymous + nonfiction), which is now live at [www.anonfiction.com](https://www.anonfiction).

*anonfiction* is not incredibly unique. It has a magazine format instead of resorting to a stream (or firehose) of content in other social media platforms. In a lot of ways, the mission of *anonfiction* is similar to other Internet magazines like [The Sun's Reader's Write], [Brevity
Magazine], [Creative Nonfiction Magazine], [100 Word Stories], [1966
Journal], [Concis], [Proximity Magazine], [Spartan Literature], and
[Thread Literary]. However, unlike these magazines, *anonfiction* is devoted to
publishing great *anonymous* *nonfiction*.

## Contributing, commenting, and editing 

Anyone can contribute to *anonfiction*. You can [write a story online](https://www.anonfiction.com/write) or email a story to [stories@anonfiction.com](mailto:stories@anonfiction.com). If you write online you can log in to keep track of your stories. Contributed stories will be curated by editors who publish them after a brief grammar-correction and anonymization. 

Anyone can also comment on stories. However, the commenting process is the exact same as the story submission process. That is, comments will be collected for each topic and presented as their own topic at the end of each month. Each comment will be anonymized and grammar-corrected, and additionally it will be removed if it is clearly offensive.

Anyone can also be an editor at *anonfiction*. To do so, just send an email to [editors@anonfiction.com](mailto:editors@anonfiction.com). At first we can correspond by email, and then after a brief period you will be added to the list of admins for the site.

## Open-source

The web is inherently open-source (hit Ctl+U to see this page's source in Firefox). In line with this, *anonfiction* is also open-source. It is basically a CMS with some authentication. The code lives at [github.com/schollz/anonfiction](https://github.com/schollz/anonfiction) and is licensed under MIT. It is written in Go and I'm happy to help with questions about it.
