Computers can do many amazing things with art, [especially with the advent of neural networks](https://deepart.io/). Computer-generated art inspired me to generate art as a human. I saw some [renditions of photos in primitives](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive), and it made me want to learn to paint in that style. Even though I'm not a painter, I thought I could do better than this computer program. So, in September 2016, I sought to become an artist using a computer as a teacher and started painting in acrylic. 

My first painting follows exactly the primitive style using only rectangles. It remains one of my favorites though it is quite amateur.

I continued painting throughout the end of 2016 and now into 2017. I've been painting mostly animals and lots of bison for some reason. One of my New Year Resolutions was to paint every week. I have been able to do that, mostly. I learned about shadows. I became better at drawing by trying to *draw what I see* instead of drawing what I *think* that I see.

I became enamored with the wet-on-wet acrylic because you could get blends of color and strokes. I also found that the primitives were too mechanical to get colors and I experimented with something more realistic.

Now, at the end of 2017, I've gone back to the using primitives, but without the restrictions on a particular shape of stroke. 

There is something wonderful about rendering the painting in a few strokes, in a primitive style. In principle it is simple - there are only a few strokes however each stroke needs a color, a position and an orientation. There are many combinations for those three options and they have widely different aesthetic appeals. Suddenly determining the next stroke becomes complicated.  However, I find the result quite appealing.

That is where I am now:

I wonder where I will be in another year.

And, for the record, I can also paint things other than bison:
