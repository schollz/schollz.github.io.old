The word *"noun"* is a singular word. It is the only word that is what it is.

Autological words are such that they are, or posses, the property that they express. 

To determine if *X* is autological, it requires answering yes to any of the following questions:

- Is *X* a *X* word?
- Is "*X*", *X*?

Dr. Henry Segerman has [a long list of these autological words](http://www.segerman.org/autological.html).
