The internet is *not* a million monkeys typing on a keyboard.[^1] Although,
there is a place on the internet that is,[^2] it seems that the current 25
billion or so webpages[^3] do not yet contain the sum of all possible thoughts. 

Its interesting to see how fast the number of possible pages drops as you
elongate a sentence. How many words does it take to be a unique sentence, on the
internet? Surprisingly few.

Lets take the sentence (which I'm making up as I type):

> A painting of a donkey in the desert.

This sentence comes from a painting I made that I'm looking at. For searching
"A" there are 25.3 billion results. The exact phrase "A painting" narrows it down
to 22.4 million. Already we've decreased by a factor of 1,000. The phrase "A
painting of" decreases it to 5.3 million (4x decrease) and adding "a donkey"
decreases it to 131,000 (50x decrease). The smallest number of results is "a
painting of a donkey in the" which yields only a single result.[^4] There are no results
for "A painting of a donkey in the desert", at least until this post is
published.


This makes sense, as there are increasing combinatorial factors that limit the probability of
a given sentence for each new word. Each word has many possibilities as there
are hundreds of thousands of 
english words. Although, most of the words are *not* possible because there are
requirements on grammar and context. We can very roughly approximate this by
solving for the 7th root (since we only had seven words that gave us a few
results) os the total number of sites (25 billion), which gives ~30. Although
this number is inflated for the nouns and deflated for the prepositions.

But the size of this number, 30, gives pause to ever think that the internet
will contain every possible sentence. Though the internet may contain most 6-7
word sentences, it would need 30x as many pages to have 8 word sentence. It
would need ~900x more pages to have 9 word sentences, and so on *exponentially*.

So far now, it is really amusing and satisfying to relish in the thought that
**most 8 word sentences we create, are totally unique to the internet and have
never existed before.** And if we extrapolate a little bit, and say that the sum
of total language *ever spoken* may be only a million times bigger than the
internet, than that would mean that **most 11 word sentences have never been
uttered before!**

Take these calculations with a big big big grain of salt, but since these
numbers lie in the world of logarithms, they won't be off my much more than
a factor of two.

[^3]: 25.3 billion is the estimate of web pages containing the letter "a" in a Google search.

in the" is from [a Yelp review
