# About

My name is Zack. 

I am an academic scientist and a programmer. 

This site, [schollz.github.io](https://schollz.github.io), is a collection of my non-academic writing. I tend to write about the [most interesting recent science](/tags/science). I also have a collection of notes about [coding](/tags/coding) and [hacks](/tags/hacks/) (hacks = coding things in a way that they aren't original meant to). 

For my academic page, [goto zackaryscholl.com](https://zackaryscholl.com/).

For my open-source programming projects, [checkout schollz.github.io/projects](https://schollz.github.io/projects) or visit [Github](https://github.com/schollz).
