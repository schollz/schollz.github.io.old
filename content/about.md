# About

My name is Zack. 

I am an academic scientist and a programmer. 

This site, [schollz.github.io](https://schollz.github.io), is a collection of non-academic writing. I write about [coding](/tags/programming) and [hacks](/tags/hacks/) (which is coding things in a way that they aren't original meant to). I also write about the [most interesting recent science](/tags/science).

For my academic page, [goto zackaryscholl.com](https://zackaryscholl.com/).

For my open-source programming projects, [goto schollz.github.io/projects](https://schollz.github.io/projects).

For a blog I run that collections Raspberry Pi projects, [goto rpiai.com](https://rpiai.com).
