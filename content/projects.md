This is a list and description of projects that I created that I still maintain.

## croc

Secure transfer of stuff from one side of the internet to the other. This is more or less (but mostly less) a Go port of @warner's magic-wormhole which allows you to directly transfer files and folders between computers.

## cowyo

A feature-rich wiki for minimalists.
This is a self-contained wiki server that makes jotting notes easy and fast. The most important feature here is simplicity. Other features include versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, and listifying. You can download cowyo as a single executable or install it with Go. Try it out at https://cowyo.com.
