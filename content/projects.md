## cowyo

A feature-rich wiki for minimalists.
This is a self-contained wiki server that makes jotting notes easy and fast. The most important feature here is simplicity. Other features include versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, and listifying. You can download cowyo as a single executable or install it with Go. Try it out at https://cowyo.com.
