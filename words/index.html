billion or so webpages<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:3><a rel=footnote href=#fn:3>3</a></sup> do not yet contain the sum of all possible thoughts. Its interesting to see how fast the number drops for possible matches on a sentence as the sentence gets longer and longer. How many words does it take to be a unique sentence, on the
internet? Surprisingly few.<h2 id=a-quick-experiment>A quick experiment</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick experiment to see how few words you need to actually
produce a totally and completely unique sentence into the universe.<p><img src=/img/donkey.jpg alt="My actual painting of a donkey in the desert."><p>Lets take the sentence (which I&rsquo;m making up as I type):<blockquote><p>A painting of a donkey in the desert.</blockquote><p>This sentence comes from a painting I made that I&rsquo;m looking at. For
searching &ldquo;A&rdquo; there are 25.3 billion results. The exact phrase &ldquo;A
painting&rdquo; narrows it down to 22.4 million. Already we&rsquo;ve decreased by
a factor of 10<sup>3</sup>. The phrase &ldquo;A painting of&rdquo; decreases it to 5.3
million (another 10<sup>~1</sup> decrease) and adding &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; decreases
it to 131,000 (another 10<sup>~2</sup> decrease). The smallest number of
results is &ldquo;a painting of a donkey in the&rdquo; which yields only a single
result (another 10<sup>~5</sup> decrease).<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:4><a rel=footnote href=#fn:4>4</a></sup> There are no results for &ldquo;A
painting of a donkey in the desert&rdquo;, at least until this post is
published.<p>This makes sense, as there are increasing combinatorial factors that limit the probability of
a given sentence for each new word. Each word has many possibilities as there
are hundreds of thousands of
English words. Although, most of the words are <em>not</em> possible because there are
requirements on grammar and context. We can very roughly approximate this by
solving for the 7th root (since we only had seven words that gave us a few
results) as the total number of sites (25 billion), which gives ~30. Although
this number is inflated for the nouns and deflated for the prepositions.<p>But the size of this number, 30, gives pause to ever think that the internet
will contain every possible sentence. Though the internet may contain most 6-7
word sentences, it would need 30x as many pages to have 8 word sentence. It
would need ~900x more pages to have 9 word sentences, and so on <em>exponentially</em>.<p>So far now, it is really amusing and satisfying to relish in the thought that
most 8 word sentences we create, are totally unique to the internet and have
never existed before. And if we extrapolate a little bit, and say that the sum
of total language ever spoken may be only a million times bigger than the
internet, than that would mean that most 11 word sentences have never been
uttered before!*<p>Take these calculations with a big big big grain of salt, but since these
numbers lie in the world of logarithms, they won&rsquo;t be off my much more
than an order of magnitude.<div class=footnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1>See the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem>infinite monkey theorem</a>
