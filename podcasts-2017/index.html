The basic premise is always to find some small thing that no one thinks about and talk about it for 20-30 minutes and often interview the main players involved in the production of the Small Things. I think the major bastion of this type of podcast is <strong><a href=https://99percentinvisible.org/>99% invisible</a></strong>, which is devoted to illuminating <em>&ldquo;all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about.&rdquo;</em><p>There seems to be a cottage industry for these types of podcasts, and I love them all. There is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/every-little-thing/>Every Little Thing</a></strong> which is <em>&ldquo;a show about the small stuff.&rdquo;</em> There is <strong><a href=http://revisionisthistory.com/about>Revisionist History</a></strong> which is Malcom Gladwell&rsquo;s show about <em>&ldquo;Something overlooked. Something misunderstood.&rdquo;</em> but mostly its just small things that Mr. Gladwell finds fascinating. There is <strong><a href=http://www.undiscoveredpodcast.org/>Undiscovered</a></strong> which is a podcast <em>&ldquo;about the all the stuff that gets left out of journal articles,&rdquo;</em> and while nominally science-based it often seeks out big stories from small things. There is <strong><a href=https://www.20k.org/>Twenty Thousand Hertz</a></strong> which is more sound-based but still aims to fill the divide because <em>&ldquo;you may not think about the sounds you hear every day.&rdquo;</em> There is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia>Invisibilia</a></strong> which <em>&ldquo;is about the invisiable forces that control human behavior&rdquo;</em> and then there is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/surprisingly-awesome/>Surprisingly Awesome</a></strong> which attempts to find fascination in the world even though <em>&ldquo;lots of things in the world seem ordinary.&rdquo;</em> For a more food-related one there is <strong><a href=http://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/the-fridge-light>The Fridge Light</a></strong> which looks at <em>&ldquo;the hidden stories of the things we eat.&rdquo;</em> Though its not around anymore, I loved listening to <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/mystery-show/>Mystery Show</a></strong> that simply <em>&ldquo;solves a minor mystery which cannot be solved with search engines.&rdquo;</em><h2 id=news-at-a-bar>News at a bar</h2><p>My other favorite podcasts are the news ones that are toned as if you were having a beer with the podcasters. They still relay information, but in a way that is so informal you barely realize that they are relaying some information that they spent their week learning. For politics, there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast>NPR politics</a></strong> and often (nowadays) <strong><a href=https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast>This American Life</a></strong>, for art there is <strong><a href=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3860>A Piece of Work</a></strong>, for science there is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/>Science Vs.</a></strong>, and for music there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered>All Songs Considered</a></strong> and for culture there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour/>Pop Culture Happy Hour</a></strong>. I love these podcasts, but I have to pace myself with them because the constant loose informality of the tone can become disingenuous and grating after awhile.<h2 id=guilty-pleasure-listening>Guilty pleasure listening</h2><p>I have some favorite podcasts that are just funny or amusing to me, and not entirely educational. These would include <strong><a href=http://www.whyohwhyradio.com/>Why oh why</a></strong> which accounts for dating in the real world (though sometimes fictionally). Then there is just the improve humor of <strong><a href=http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me>My Brother My Brother and Me</a></strong> which I enjoy just to hear people crack themselves up.</div></div><footer><p><small><em>Written December 31, 2017.</em></small><p><small>Leave a comment for me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40yakcar%20%23podcasts-2017%20">@yakczar</a>.</small></span></footer>
