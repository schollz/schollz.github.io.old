Lots of
the time I listen to music, but I&rsquo;ve started to listen to podcasts. I&rsquo;ve
found a lot of great podcasts out there. I think my number one category of
podcast is the <strong>Podcast about the beauty in small things</strong>. Its always
a welcome relief from the mainstream media which focuses more on the
hyperbole of small things. I do like some news, but I&rsquo;ve found some great
podcasts that pitch the news in a more informal and friendly way. These
are my favorite podcasts discovered this year, I hope I continue to
discover new ones.<h2 id=podcasts-about-small-things>Podcasts about Small Things</h2><p>My favorite type of podcast is this generic theme of podcast which I can
call <em>The Podcast of Small Things</em>. The basic premise is always to find
some small thing that no one thinks about and talk about it for 20-30
minutes and often interview the main players involved in the production
of the Small Things. I think the major bastion of this type of podcast is
<strong><a href=https://99percentinvisible.org/>99% invisible</a></strong>, which is devoted to
illuminating <em>&ldquo;all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think
about.&rdquo;</em><p>There seems to be a cottage industry for these types of podcasts, and
I love them all. There is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/every-little-thing/>Every Little
Thing</a></strong> which is <em>&ldquo;a show
about the small stuff.&rdquo;</em> There is <strong><a href=http://revisionisthistory.com/about>Revisionist
History</a></strong> which is Malcom Gladwell&rsquo;s
show about <em>&ldquo;Something overlooked. Something misunderstood.&rdquo;</em> but mostly
its just small things that Mr. Gladwell finds fascinating. There is
<strong><a href=http://www.undiscoveredpodcast.org/>Undiscovered</a></strong> which is a podcast
<em>&ldquo;about the all the stuff that gets left out of journal articles,&rdquo;</em> and
while nominally science-based it often seeks out big stories from small
things. There is <strong><a href=https://www.20k.org/>Twenty Thousand Hertz</a></strong> which
is more sound-based but still aims to fill the divide because <em>&ldquo;you may
not think about the sounds you hear every day.&rdquo;</em> There is
<strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia>Invisibilia</a></strong> which
<em>&ldquo;is about the invisiable forces that control human behavior&rdquo;</em> and then
there is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/surprisingly-awesome/>Surprisingly
Awesome</a></strong> which attempts
to find fascination in the world even though <em>&ldquo;lots of things in the world
seem ordinary.&rdquo;</em> For a more food-related one there is <strong><a href=http://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/the-fridge-light>The Fridge
Light</a></strong> which
looks at <em>&ldquo;the hidden stories of the things we eat.&rdquo;</em> Another food one is
<strong><a href=http://creative.gimletmedia.com/show/why-we-eat-what-we-eat/about/>Why We Eat What We
Eat</a></strong>
which <em>&ldquo;investigates the unseen forces that shape our eatings habits.</em>&ldquo;
Though its not around anymore, I loved listening to <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/mystery-show/>Mystery
Show</a></strong> that simply <em>&ldquo;solves
a minor mystery which cannot be solved with search engines.&rdquo;</em><h2 id=news-at-a-bar>News at a bar</h2><p>My other favorite podcasts are the news ones that are toned as if you were having a beer with the podcasters. They still relay information, but in a way that is so informal you barely realize that they are relaying some information that they spent their week learning. For politics, there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast>NPR politics</a></strong> and often (nowadays) <strong><a href=https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast>This American Life</a></strong>, for art there is <strong><a href=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3860>A Piece of Work</a></strong>, for science there is <strong><a href=https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/>Science Vs.</a></strong>, and for music there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered>All Songs Considered</a></strong> and for culture there is <strong><a href=http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour/>Pop Culture Happy Hour</a></strong>. I love these podcasts, but I have to pace myself with them because the constant loose informality of the tone can become disingenuous and grating after awhile.<h2 id=guilty-pleasure-listening>Guilty pleasure listening</h2><p>I have some favorite podcasts that are just funny or amusing to me, and
not entirely educational. These would include <strong><a href=http://www.whyohwhyradio.com/>Why oh
why</a></strong> which accounts for dating in the
real world (though sometimes fictionally). Another great one is
<strong><a href=http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/>Beautiful
Anonymous</a></strong> which is
sometimes about dating, but it is mostly about the real world. Then there
is just the improve humor of <strong><a href=http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me>My Brother My Brother and
Me</a></strong> which
I enjoy just to hear people crack themselves up.</div><footer><p><small><em>Written December 31, 2017.</em>
