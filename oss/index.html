 <h1>OSS divisions</h1>

<p>There are two reasons I think its good for <em>everyone</em> to have a good division between &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS):</p>

<p><strong>1. If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits.</strong></p>

<p>While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit. Thus, I encourage you to find a model that supports you, because that will also support all of us personal users!</p>

<p><strong>2. I trust more in your OSS code if it has some sort of drawback for personal users.</strong></p>

<p>If you offered the exact same features for corporate and personal use, I would believe this <em>too good to be true</em>. Things that seem <em>too good to be true</em> are often nefarious in hidden ways (for example, Facebook lets you post photos and add friends for free, but they can collect and sell your data).</p>

<p>If you are transparent about what is different for personal users then it makes me happy to have a drawback so I can be assured that something sketchy isn&rsquo;t happening to monetize this in another way.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately most people think they are entitled to OSS new features, bug fixes, general support. But unfortunately for them, you don&rsquo;t owe anything to anyone excepting your business clients. Your business is your business, and whatever you happen to let spill over in the open-source community should only be seen as a benefit, never a negative, to the universe of open-source code.</p>
