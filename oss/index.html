If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits.</strong><p>While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&rsquo;t go away.<p>Since I&rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit. Thus, I encourage you to find a model that supports you, because that will also support all of us personal users!<p><strong>2. I trust more in your OSS code if it has some sort of drawback for personal users.</strong><p>If you offered the exact same features for corporate and personal use, I would believe this <em>too good to be true</em>. Things that seem <em>too good to be true</em> are often nefarious in hidden ways (for example, Facebook lets you post photos and add friends for free, but they can collect and sell your data).<p>If you are transparent about what is different for personal users then it makes me happy to have a drawback so I can be assured that something sketchy isn&rsquo;t happening to monetize this in another way.<p><strong>Unfortunately&hellip;</strong><p>Unfortunately most people think they are entitled to OSS new features, bug fixes, general support. But unfortunately for them, you don&rsquo;t owe anything to anyone excepting your business clients. Your business is your business, and whatever you happen to let spill over in the open-source community should only be seen as a benefit, never a negative, to the universe of open-source code.</article><footer><p><em><small>Written September 17, 2017.</em> Leave a comment for me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40yakcar%20%23oss%20">@yakczar</a>.</small></footer><a href=/beware-of-the-free-trial/>← Beware of the free trial</a>&nbsp;<a href=/music-2017/ style=float:right>Music in 2017 →</a>
