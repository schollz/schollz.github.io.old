 <h1>Music in 2017</h1>

<p>I have been using <em>Spotify Discovery Weekly</em> playlists, <em>Sound Opinions</em> podcast, and the <em>NPR All Songs Considered</em> podcast to discover all sorts of great music.</p>

<p><strong>Orchestral Variations</strong> by <em>Minor Victories</em></p>

<p>From what I understand, this is a symphonic cover album of a indie rock album. I&rsquo;ve listened to the rock album a little and I can&rsquo;t understand why this orchestral version is so much better.</p>

<p><strong>Men I Trust</strong> by <em>Men I Trust</em></p>

<p>This keeps getting suggested to me, and with good reason. Its a great indie pop album.</p>

<p><strong>EP</strong> by <em>Joon Moon</em></p>

<p>Joon Moon is one of my favorite new bands. The ensemble is simple - piano, drums and vocals. But each is absolutely amazing on its own.</p>

<p><strong>There and Back</strong> by <em>Tangerine</em></p>

<p>This is like a modern-day Simon and Garfunkle, with a little bit of Bob Dylan.</p>

<p><strong>A Deeper Understanding</strong> by <em>The War On Drugs</em></p>

<p>Probably my favorite band right now, and with a new album which somehow is almost better than the last.</p>

<p><strong>If You See Me, Say Yes</strong> by <em>Flock of Dimes</em></p>

<p>A great album to listen to front to back.</p>

<p><strong>Cave</strong> by <em>Future Islands</em></p>

<p>This album will always remind me of Canada, since I listened to pieces of it while driving through.</p>

<p><strong>Silence</strong> by <em>Tom Adams</em></p>

<p>A discovery from <em>All Songs Considered</em> which is a very mellow and soothing album.</p>
