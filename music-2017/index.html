I&rsquo;ve listened to the rock album a little and I can&rsquo;t understand why this orchestral version is so much better.<p><strong>Men I Trust</strong> by <em>Men I Trust</em><p>This keeps getting suggested to me, and with good reason. Its a great indie pop album.<p><strong>EP</strong> by <em>Joon Moon</em><p>Joon Moon is one of my favorite new bands. The ensemble is simple - piano, drums and vocals. But each is absolutely amazing on its own.<p><strong>There and Back</strong> by <em>Tangerine</em><p>This is like a modern-day Simon and Garfunkle, with a little bit of Bob Dylan.<p><strong>A Deeper Understanding</strong> by <em>The War On Drugs</em><p>Probably my favorite band right now, and with a new album which somehow is almost better than the last.<p><strong>If You See Me, Say Yes</strong> by <em>Flock of Dimes</em><p>A great album to listen to front to back.<p><strong>Cave</strong> by <em>Future Islands</em><p>This album will always remind me of Canada, since I listened to pieces of it while driving through.<p><strong>Silence</strong> by <em>Tom Adams</em><p>A discovery from <em>All Songs Considered</em> which is a very mellow and soothing album.</div><footer><p><small><em>Written December 31, 2017.
