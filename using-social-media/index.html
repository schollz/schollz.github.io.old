thoughts and ideas. Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit
thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to
use social media without being social.<p>I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it. This way, I can use the cutting edge technology ecosystem and infrastructure of social media giants for my own personal journal.<p>I do program, so I could write my own diary program (and I have). But there is something nice about having a ready-made solution with so much support. In fact, just Twitter <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=twitter&amp;type=">has almost 100,000 repositories</a> of varying quality for interfacing with it. This means, if you decide you want a Twitter library written in [random language] then you probably can find it.<h2 id=social-media-as-a-private-experience>Social media as a private experience</h2><p>Here is how I use my social media. I am using Twitter, but that is interchangeable with most of the other platforms, as they are all big enough to have support. I could&rsquo;ve easily done the same with Facebook, Tumblr, etc.<h3 id=keep-track-of-things-to-do>Keep track of things to do</h3><p>I like to do stuff from the command-line, so I found one of the 100,000 repos devoted to interfacing with Twitter: <a href=https://github.com/sferik/t>https://github.com/sferik/t</a>. Its well written and supported, and its easy to use. I use this for some of my updates.<p>I keep a list of things todo. Using <em>t</em> I can easily see what I have todo:<pre><code>&gt; t search timeline  '#todo' | more 
#todo get ice cube trays from the dollar store
#todo get a haircut
</code></pre><p>or update my todo-list<pre><code>&gt; t update &quot;#todo mow the lawn&quot;
Tweet posted by @?.

Run `t delete status ?` to delete.
</code></pre><p>And if I&rsquo;m on my phone, I can just go to my Twitter feed to quickly look at a grocery list, or update something I need to do.<p><em>Sample tweets from my #todo feed:</em><div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#todo</a>
Make a collection of web articles that cite me</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 23, 2017</a></div><div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><p><a href=#>#todo</a>
get a haircut</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 20, 2017</a></div><h3 id=quickly-jotting-random-thoughts>Quickly jotting random thoughts</h3><p>My twitter feed is best for random thoughts. I like that the Twitter application is polished enough that you can use it anywhere, even when there is no data/wifi. The draft will be saved and posted when you reach a place that does.<p>This failsafe is hard to program into things I make, so I&rsquo;m glad that I can take advantage of this to post random thoughts, such as:<div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>Super-autological words<br><br>The word Noun is defined by being a noun.<br>The word Polysyllabic is defined by being polysyllabic.</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 23, 2017</a></div><div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><p>vanilla ice cream in a unwashed cup of licorice tea is amazing</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 20, 2017</a></div><h3 id=using-ifttt-to-keep-track-of-everything-else>Using IFTTT to keep track of everything else</h3><p>There are many things you can hook up to <a href=https://ifttt.com/>IFTTT</a>, to
keep a record of in your Twitter biography. For example:<ol><li><p>Keep track of songs I like on Spotify. <em>E.g.</em>:<div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><p><a href=#>#music</a>
"Rusalka, Op. 114, B. 203, Act I: Lieblicher Mond (Song to the Moon)" by Antonín Dvořák, Emalie Savoy, Bran…</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 20, 2017</a></div><li><p>Record the daily weather. <em>E.g.</em>:<div class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#weather</a> Light Rain today, high of 42, low of 36, currently 37</p>&mdash; Zak (@?) <a href=#>September 21, 2017</a></div><li><p>Connect public life (Facebook, Instagram) to Twitter so my private log is updated.<li><p>Keep track of my movements with the IFTTT geofencing.</ol><h1 id=caveats>Caveats</h1><p>Obviously, Twitter is a company basically offering a service for free.
I would always be wary of that. So, I would never post things that are
truly secret (i.e. passwords, bank statements, etc.).<p>Also, I chose Twitter because it has a option for export. Their export
option is suboptimal (it only updates every two weeks or so), but it is
a requirement that I can have my data that I create.</div><p><small><em>Written September 23, 2017.</em>
