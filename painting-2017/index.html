In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was <a href=https://github.com/fogleman/primitive>a rendition of photos in primitives</a>, and it made me want to learn to paint in that style. Even though I&rsquo;m not a painter, I thought I could do better than this computer program. So, in September 2016, I sought to become an artist using a computer as a teacher and started painting in acrylic.<p>I started out trying to take a photo and paint primitives. The photo I chose was of a bison:<p><img src=/img/bison_sergioboccardo_shutterstock3.jpg alt="Stock image of Bison I chose to use">
<img src=/img/bison_primitives.gif alt="Primitive procedure generated"><p>My first painting follows exactly the primitive style using only rectangles. It remains one of my favorites though it is quite amateur.<p><img src=/img/bison20160926.jpg alt="“First Bison” - acrylic on canvas, September 2016"><p>I continued painting throughout the end of 2016 and now into 2017. I&rsquo;ve been painting mostly animals and lots of bison for some reason. One of my New Year Resolutions was to paint every week. I have been able to do that, mostly. I learned about shadows. I became better at drawing by trying to <em>draw what I see</em> instead of drawing what I <em>think</em> that I see.<p>I became enamored with the wet-on-wet acrylic because you could get blends of color and strokes. I also found that the primitives were too mechanical to get colors and I experimented with something more realistic.<p><img src=/img/bison20170701.jpg alt="“Bison” - acrylic on canvas, July 2017"><p>Now, at the end of 2017, I&rsquo;ve gone back to the using primitives, but without the restrictions on a particular shape of stroke.<p>There is something wonderful about rendering the painting in a few strokes, in a primitive style. In principle it is simple - there are only a few strokes however each stroke needs a color, a position and an orientation. There are many combinations for those three options and they have widely different aesthetic appeals. Suddenly determining the next stroke becomes complicated. However, I find the result quite appealing.<p>That is where I am now:<p><img src=/img/bison20171202.jpg alt="“Bison” - acrylic on canvas, December 2017"><p>I wonder where I will be in another year.<p>And, for the record, I can also paint things other than bison:<p><img src=/img/robin20171203.jpg alt="“European Robin” - acrylic on canvas, December 2017"></div><footer><p><small><em>Written December 3, 2017.</em>
