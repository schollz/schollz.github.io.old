I might need it, assume, at some point. However, this is never true. To get myself out of this &amp;ldquo;I might need it*&amp;rdquo; mindset, I started deleting my Downloads/ folder every time I start my computer. This way, I had to remember, that anything I put in there would disappear when I turned my computer off.</description></item><item><title>Sending a file in 2017</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/sending-a-file/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2017 20:11:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/sending-a-file/</guid><description>My good friend Jessie and I want to watch a documentary movie on turkeys together.1 I have the file on my computer and she does not, so I want to send this file to her directly2 from my computer. There are a couple of restrictions though:
the turkey documentary is a ~1 GB file Jessie lives 2,000 miles away in a different country Jessie uses Windows OS Jessie is not a programmer, and avoids anything that involves running something on the command-line How should I send the movie, in the fastest possible way, so we can start learning about turkeys together?</description></item><item><title>Send a file with IPFS</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/ipfs-transfer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 21:27:07 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/ipfs-transfer/</guid><description>Sending a file with IPFS is fun (after all it is leveraging the peer-to-peer network and content-addressable blocks of data!) and easy.
Install IPFS Here is the basic instructions to install:
wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.4.11/go-ipfs_v0.4.11_linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf go-ipfs* cd go-ipfs sudo ./install.sh ipfs init ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001 ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001 The last two lines are useful for listening on LAN connected devices. The port 0.0.0.0 will let run the IPFS daemon on a different computer but still use the peer-to-peer portal from that computer.</description></item><item><title>What we say has never been said</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/words/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:16:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/words/</guid><description>All that humans has ever been written on the internet is not a million monkeys typing on a keyboard (although a million monkeys typing on a keyboard could produce all the current content),1 with exception of a website that generates random text.2 Still, it seems that the current 25 billion or so webpages3 do not yet contain the sum of all possible thoughts.

It can do simple things, like generating site maps. It can also do complicated things, like extracting all the quotes from every page on a quotes website (tutorial follows).
Install First get Docker which will be used for running Redis.
Then you can simply download crawdad:
$ wget https://github.com/schollz/crawdad/releases/download/v3.0.0/crawdad_3.0.0_linux_amd64.zip $ unzip crawdad*zip $ sudo mv crawdad*amd64 /usr/local/bin/crawdad Unlike many other scraping frameworks, crawdad is a single binary that has no dependencies.</description></item><item><title>Read news in the terminal with Docker</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/docker-news/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 05:44:33 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/docker-news/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on readable, a simple bookmarklet for easily reading articles in the browser (Github).

This is useful when using Markdown to generate HTML pages, since Markdown in its natural form only includes creates an image tag, i.e. ![alt tag](img src) -&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;alt tag&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;img src&amp;quot;&amp;gt;. For good captions, we need to add a figcaption and wrap both inside a figure.
Turns out this is easily done with Javascript to generate figure captions on the load of the page.</description></item><item><title>How much ice do you need?</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/ice-cubes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2017 09:43:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/ice-cubes/</guid><description>MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]], displayMath: [[&#39;$$&#39;,&#39;$$&#39;], [&#39;\[&#39;,&#39;\]&#39;]], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, &#34;HTML-CSS&#34;: { linebreaks: { automatic: true } }, SVG: { linebreaks: { automatic: true } }, skipTags: [&#39;script&#39;, &#39;noscript&#39;, &#39;style&#39;, &#39;textarea&#39;, &#39;pre&#39;], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: &#34;AMS&#34; }, extensions: [&#34;AMSmath.js&#34;, &#34;AMSsymbols.js&#34;] } } }); MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() { // Fix tags after MathJax finishes running.

Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me.

If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away.

Cataracts are most commonly associated with age, but there are about 20 million people on Earth that were born with cataracts. The cause of these congenital cataracts are varied but most suggest that its the crystallin proteins themselves that get mutated. (1) The eye produces these crystallin proteins that are supposed to last a lifetime, so when they are mutated they become unstable and cause cataracts!</description></item><item><title>How can a protein tune the circadian rhythms by switching its fold?</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/protein-switching/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/protein-switching/</guid><description>Proteins are central to biology. For the most part, proteins in the body are crucial for catalyzing reactions that carry out almost all of our biologial processes. For a protein to be useful, after it&amp;rsquo;s made by a ribosome, it needs to fold into a 3-dimensional structure that is unique to its sequence.
Its been widely thought that every unique sequence corresponds to a single unique structure. However, in biology, there are always exceptions to the rule.</description></item><item><title>How do ants survive in the heat in the Sahara desert?</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/ants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/ants/</guid><description>There is a class of ants that survive in the Sahara desert despite it being one of the hottest places on Earth, where the surface temperature can reach up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

However, different animals can understand language on different levels, as noted by Steven Pinker in his book The Language Instinct:
The most receptive trainee for an artificial language with a syntax and semantics has been a parrot; the species with the best claim to recursive structure in its signaling has been the starling; the best vocal imitators are birds and dolphins; and when it comes to reading human intentions, chimps are bested by man&amp;rsquo;s best friend, Canis familiaris.</description></item><item><title>Protein folding, simulation vs. experiment</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/simulation-and-experiment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/simulation-and-experiment/</guid><description>Prigozhin et al. has brought simulations and experiments of protein dynamics closer together than ever before.
