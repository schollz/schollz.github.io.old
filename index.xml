      <description>Illumination in the Flatwoods by Joe Hutto
My favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.
Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins
My second-favorite book of 2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre way than imaginable.</description>

      <description>I have been using Spotify Discovery Weekly playlists, Sound Opinions podcast, and the NPR All Songs Considered podcast to discover all sorts of great music.
Orchestral Variations by Minor Victories
From what I understand, this is a symphonic cover album of a indie rock album. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to the rock album a little and I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why this orchestral version is so much better.

      <title>OSS divisions</title>

      <description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS):
1. If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits.
While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description>

      <description>tldr: A big company billed me for years without my knowledge. However, they unknowingly violated their own Conditions of Use so I got my money refunded
I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong. I had a charge of $15 for The Service (a big company that I will not name here), a service I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used for years after I tried one of their free items.</description>

      <description>Lots of people ask me this question, and I end up writing the same answer over and over. I just wrote my plain answer here so I can just link to it! Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to ask me other questions, though if you need. â€‹ The answer is: because of time and money.
Golang saves me time When I write code, I often write run the program periodically to test it.</description>

      <description>This quote by Oscar Wilde,
 &amp;ldquo;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&amp;rdquo;,
 is wrong.
By doing everything in moderation &amp;ndash; including moderation &amp;ndash; then that means you are overdoing moderation, which the quote forbids.
It should be amended:
 &amp;ldquo;Everything in moderation, excepting moderation.&amp;rdquo;
