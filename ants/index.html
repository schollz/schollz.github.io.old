These ants, called &ldquo;silver ants&rdquo; or <em>Cataglyphis bombycina</em> have recently been found to harbor specialized triangular hairs that enable them significantly increased thermoregulation, as <a href=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6245/298.full>reported in the recent issue of <em>Science</em></a>. [1] Though the surface of the desert exceeds 150F, the ants can keep an internal temperature of 120F. They do this be frequently cooling off, but the brunt of the work is done by specialized little <strong>hairs that are triangular</strong>.<aside><h4>Did you know? Some facts about ants!</h4><ul><li>The total weight of all ants is at least as heavy as the total weight of all humans!<li>Ants can hold up to 100x their own weight.<li>Ants can live up to 30 years.<li>Some ant colonies can reach thousands of miles across.</ul></aside><h2 id=so-what>So what?</h2><p>Triangular hairs are one of Nature&rsquo;s way of producing the best solution to a common problem. Hairs can reflect sunlight thus preventing their internal organs from heating up. It turns out that triangular hairs are better than circular hairs because it allows for better <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection>total internal reflection</a>. Total internal reflection is a phenomenon where light is entirely reflected and not transmitted if the striking angle is bigger than the &ldquo;critical&rdquo; angle. Having a triangular hair helps to reflect much more of the incoming light which prevents heating up the ant!<h2 id=who-cares>Who cares?</h2><p>Preventing solar radiation is a problem that lots of engineers encounter when building devices and infrastructure. This discovery shows that there are more clever solutions to producing high reflectivity thus eliminating a lot of the heat transmission to the inside.<h3 id=references>References</h3><ol><li>Shi, Norman Nan, et al. &ldquo;Keeping cool: Enhanced optical reflection and heat dissipation in silver ants.&rdquo; <em>Science</em> (New York, NY) (2015).</ol></div><footer><p><small><em>Written July 17, 2015.</em>
