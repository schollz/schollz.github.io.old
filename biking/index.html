 <h1>Open letter to Duke P&amp;T</h1>

<p>Dear Parking &amp; Transportation,</p>

<p>I am writing to you about my experience as a Duke bike-commuter for the past six years. To preface, I have been a bike commuter, in total, for 15 years. I&rsquo;ve commuted between home and school and work in all the places I&rsquo;ve lived - Seattle, New York, and Durham - about 3&ndash;6 miles every day. Unfortunately, I think the most unsafe place I&rsquo;ve biked is within the Duke University campus.</p>

<p>The only crashes I&rsquo;ve ever had were consequences of traveling from my home to my laboratory at CIEMAS. Both crashes involved an oncoming vehicle which neglected to use a turn signal and neglected to yield to oncoming traffic. Both times the driver assumed I was biking slowly enough that they could get by, but both times they were wrong and I had to crash my bike into the ground to avoid hitting them.</p>

<p>I am involved in close-calls nearly every week. It&rsquo;s almost always one of two scenarios - either a vehicle passes on the left and then proceeds to immediately turn to the right in front of a bicyclist, without signaling; or an oncoming vehicle decides to not yield to an oncoming bike but miscalculates the speed of the biker causing a collision when they perform a turn. This is a very frequent occurrence on Campus Drive and Circuit, in fact it happened again to me last night by a Duke bus!</p>

<p>I do realize that Duke is not liable for all the vehicles driving on their campus. However, I estimate that about 40% of these occurrences are due to Duke employee vehicles (employees coming to work on Campus Drive or parking near Circuit) or due to Duke buses (which are frequently the most aggressive in cutting me off when oncoming, or passing me in dangerous areas).</p>

<p>I also realize that bikes are partly to blame. I understand that bikes have the same rights and responsibilities as vehicles, but I&rsquo;ve noticed bikes frequently not stopping at 4-way stops and performing other illegal maneuvers which cause drivers to lose their confidence in a bicyclist&rsquo;s ability to follow the rules. However, just like Duke can&rsquo;t necessarily control all of the drivers, they shouldn&rsquo;t expect to control all the bikes.</p>

<p>With that said, I think that Duke&rsquo;s initiative toward sustainability and transportation safety should include some improvements that could benefit bikers with little cost to drivers and Duke. I think the major problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>construction impedes bicycle lanes, and construction is always ongoing in various places</li>
<li>parking lanes impede bicycle lanes</li>
<li>bicycle lanes nonexistent in various areas (bridge to East, parts of Campus Drive, Science dr. and Research dr.) -aggressive driving behavior of Duke personnel (buses and employees)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think a possible solution to these issues is to use frequent bicycle lane pavement markings along all roads in Duke University campus. This is a modest and inexpensive improvement that, at the very least, reminds drivers that bikes are also vehicles and this encourages bicyclists to appropriate more road when the conditions necessitate. Personally, when I bike down Campus drive, I only feel safe by using part of the road outside the thin bicycle lane, but this frequently causes extremely aggressive behavior by drivers (like one who honked at me for 3 minutes just this morning).</p>

<p>I’ve heard your employees talk about the Duke Parking &amp; Transportation department as “the most hated department on campus” which I assure you is not my sentiment or purpose of this letter. I understand you try to make ends meet with the resources that you have, and for the most part it seems to work well. For the parts that do not, I hope you will find some helpful feedback in this letter.</p>
