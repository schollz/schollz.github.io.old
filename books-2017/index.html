in college</a>), but I did a lot of magazine reading too (e.g.
<em>The Sun</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>). The books that I read can be classified
into three major categories: <em>non-fictional animal encounters</em>, <em>magical
horror realism</em> and <em>fictional non-fiction.</em><p>The first main category are books I read in 2017 are about <em>non-fictional animal encounters</em>. My favorite book in this category, and of 2017 overall, is <strong>Illumination in the Flat-woods</strong> by <em>Joe Hutto</em>. Its the real-like story of an experiment to raise turkey&rsquo;s through their entire life.
I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read
this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they
were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book (i.e. replicating the experiment). I can say, for
sure, that I think turkeys are amazing now. I will still eat turkey, but
now with a reverence I never had before.<p>I started out the year reading <strong>What a Fish Knows</strong> by <em>Jonathan
Balcombe</em>. I didn&rsquo;t quite finish this book - the first chapters a good but
it turns into a bit of a direct plea to save the fish instead of an
account of how amazing they are. An animal book shouldn&rsquo;t need to make
a direct plea
- the book should show enough how amazing the animals are and the reader
can decide for themselves, and its a hard decision to make if you learn
how awesome some of these animals are.<p>Another good example of animal writing is <strong>Last Chance to See</strong> by
<em>Douglas Adams</em> is an interesting investigation of animals near
extinction, circa
1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the
Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and
entertaining book. Adams is a funny person and he gives some levity to
some of the dark topics. He is also a great everyman in the book who has
lots of things explained to him in a simple way - so its easy to pick up
information.<p><img src=/img/bisons.jpg alt="Every week I run in Elk Island to see Bison"><p>I&rsquo;ve been going out to see Bison every week now. I live in Edmonton, so
I&rsquo;m not far from Elk Island where there is a ton of wildish bison roaming
around. I&rsquo;ve literally run into them on the trail. Anyways, they are quite
impressive animals, and I wanted to learn more about them. I found a great
book, <strong>American Bison</strong> by <em>Steven Rinella</em>, which goes into their
history. A lot of the focus is on hunting, but hunting in a humane way
which is really interesting to learn about. Its a very respectful book
about the bison with lots of great information.<p>The next major category of book that I really enjoyed are books about
<em>magical horror realism</em>. I didn&rsquo;t realize this was a genre, but once
I found it I realized it was something that I really enjoyed. <strong>Library at
Mount Char</strong> by <em>Scott Hawkins</em> is my second-favorite book of
2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre
way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to
science fiction.<p>Another thrilling book I read was <strong>Weaveworld</strong> by <em>Clive Barker</em>, an
epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they
merge at the end. Great read. I actually found the previous book after
reading this book and trying to find another book that matched it, to
which I wrote <a href=https://rpiai.com/why-i-made-a-book-recommendation-service/>an entire
program</a>
which ended up becoming a website for people:
<a href=https://www.booksuggestions.ninja>booksuggestions.ninja</a>.<p>The third major category that I greatly enjoyed is of <em>ficiontal
non-fiction.</em> The first book I read of 2017 was <strong>Pieces of the Left
Hand</strong> by <em>J. Robert Lennon</em> and it is a little work of genius. They are
a collection of very, very short tales of a seemingly non-fictional
account of the author&rsquo;s life. The stories of very mundane things - stories
about the locals smashing mailboxes and dinner parties. Except they
inexplicably almost always take a weird and unbelievable end.<p>I have a soft spot for nonconformist writers like Bukowski and Hunter
Thompson. I found <strong>Gonzo Girl</strong> by <em>Cheryl Della Pietra</em> to be an
extraordinary fictional account of an assistant to Hunter Thompson. A lot
of it delves into tropes about genius (drug addition is a trope that it
seems to try to destroy) and sexism (which the author herself constantly
proclaims and then falls right into). Still, the writing is very good.<p><strong>Imaginary Imagnitude</strong> by <em>Stainslaw Lem</em> is a wholly amazing book
- from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of
books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that
communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is
still funny nevertheless.<p>Towards the end of the year I read <strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong> by <em>Liu Cixin</em> which I saw was recommended by former president Barack Obama. It gladdens my heart that this book in particular was recommended by Obama - its about the looming destruction of Earth by an Alien race which undermines humans by attempting to destroy their progress in <em>basic science</em>. The importance of basic science in this book makes me think that Obama may have had similar sentiments. Anways, the book is great - its translated well from Chinese and has lots of great information about the Chinese revolution and communism. The science explainations are not bad either.<h2 id=epistemological-articles>Epistemological articles</h2><p>One author has been sticking out to me this year
- <em>Kathryn Schultz</em>. Whenever I read her articles I instantly realize its
her - she has an amazing knack for taking any kind of thesis and detailing
a complete and thoughtful story around it. She seems to like to take
strange thesis too. The first one I read was on <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum>Henry Thoreau as
a hypocrite</a> (of
which I totally disagree but love the writing). My favorite from this year
were <strong><a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/how-to-be-a-know-it-all>How to be
a know-it-all</a></strong>
which posits that its easy to learn a little bit about everything and
<strong><a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/06/is-bigfoot-likelier-than-the-loch-ness-monster>Fantastic beasts and how to rank
them</a></strong>
which tries to understand why its possible to make judgements about things
that don&rsquo;t exist.<h2 id=other-books>Other books</h2><ul><li><strong>Calculating God</strong> by <em>Robert J.
