<short-rule><a href=https://schollz.github.io/tags/thoughts/ class=w3-tag>thoughts</a><br><br></short-rule></title-block><p>I&rsquo;ve read about 15 books this year, not as many as I usually do and not as many as I&rsquo;d like to. Although I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of the <em>New Yorker</em> which takes up quite a bit of my reading time.<p><strong>Illumination in the Flatwoods</strong> by <em>Joe Hutto</em> is my favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.<p><strong>Library at Mount Char</strong> by <em>Scott Hawkins</em> is my second-favorite book of 2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to science fiction.<p><strong>Last Chance to See</strong> by <em>Douglas Adams</em> is an interesting investigation of animals near extinction, circa 1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and entertaining book.<p><strong>Imaginary Imagnitude</strong> by <em>Stainslaw Lem</em> is a wholly amazing book - from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is still funny nevertheless.<p><strong>Weaveworld</strong> by <em>Clive Barker</em> is an epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they merge at the end. Great read.<p><strong>Gonzo Girl</strong> by <em>Cheryl Della Pietra</em> is an extraordinary fictional account of an assistant to Hunter Thompson. A lot of it dwelves into tropes about genius (drug addition = create genius??) and sexism (which the author herself constantly proclaims and then falls right into). Still, the writing is very good.<p><strong>Calculating God</strong> by <em>Robert J. Sawyer</em> is a fun <em>fictional</em> book with some interesting ideas about other worlds having simultaneous mass extinctions. I&rsquo;ve never read a book which addresses the search for G-d in such a scientific way, which is really the best way to go for it.<p>Other books I&rsquo;ve read that I thought were good (since I read through them):<ul><li><strong>Hard Magic</strong> by <em>Larry Correia</em><li><strong>Death Comes for the Archbishop</strong> by <em>Willa Cather</em><li><strong>Everyone&rsquo;s An Aliebn when you&rsquo;re an Aliebn Too</strong> by <em>Jomny Sun</em><li><strong>Jack Reacher 61 hours</strong> by <em>Lee Child</em><li><strong>True Grit</strong> by <em>Charles Portis</em><li><strong>Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo</strong> by <em>Obert Skye</em><li><strong>Pieces of the Left Hand</strong> by <em>J. Robert Lennon</em><li><strong>American Bison</strong> by <em>Steven Rinella</em></ul></div></div><footer><p><small><em>Written December 31, 2017.</em></small><p><small>Leave a comment for me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40yakcar%20%23books-2017%20">@yakczar</a>.</small></span></footer>
