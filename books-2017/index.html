  <h1>Books read in 2017</h1>

<p><strong>Illumination in the Flatwoods</strong> by <em>Joe Hutto</em></p>

<p>My favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.</p>

<p><strong>Library at Mount Char</strong> by <em>Scott Hawkins</em></p>

<p>My second-favorite book of 2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to science fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Last Chance to See</strong> by <em>Douglas Adams</em>.</p>

<p>An interesting investigation of animals near extinction, circa 1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and entertaining book.</p>

<p><strong>Imaginary Imagnitude</strong> by <em>Stainslaw Lem</em></p>

<p>A wholly amazing book - from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is still funny nevertheless.</p>

<p><strong>Weaveworld</strong> by <em>Clive Barker</em></p>

<p>An epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they merge at the end. Great read.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Magic</strong> by <em>Larry Correia</em></p>

<p><strong>Death Comes for the Archbishop</strong> by <em>Willa Cather</em></p>

<p><strong>Everyone&rsquo;s An Aliebn when you&rsquo;re an Aliebn Too</strong> by <em>Jomny Sun</em></p>

<p><strong>Jack Reacher 61 hours</strong> by <em>Lee Child</em></p>

<p><strong>True Grit</strong> by <em>Charles Portis</em></p>

<p><strong>Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo</strong> by <em>Obert Skye</em></p>

<p><strong>Pieces of the Left Hand</strong> by <em>J. Robert Lennon</em></p>
