many as I&rsquo;d like to. Although I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of the <em>New Yorker</em>
which takes up quite a bit of my reading time. I can lump my reading into
some broad categories.<h2 id=non-fictional-animal-encounters>Non-fictional animal encounters</h2><p>I started out the year reading <strong>What a Fish Knows</strong> by <em>Jonathan
Balcombe</em>. I didn&rsquo;t quite finish this book - the first chapters a good but
it turns into a bit of a direct plea to save the fish instead of an
account of how amazing they are. An animal book shouldn&rsquo;t need to make
a direct plea - the book should show enough how amazing the animals are
and the reader can decide for themselves, and its a hard decision to make
if you learn how awesome some of these animals are.<p>The being said, <strong>Illumination in the Flat-woods</strong> by <em>Joe Hutto</em> is my
favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read
this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they
were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book. I can say, for
sure, that I think turkeys are amazing now. I will still eat turkey, but
now with a reverence I never had before.<p>Another good example of animal writing is <strong>Last Chance to See</strong> by
<em>Douglas Adams</em> is an interesting investigation of animals near
extinction, circa
1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the
Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and
entertaining book. Adams is a funny person and he gives some levity to
some of the dark topics. He is also a great everyman in the book who has
lots of things explained to him in a simple way - so its easy to pick up
information.<p><img src=/img/bisons.jpg alt="Every week I run in Elk Island to see Bison"><p>I&rsquo;ve been going out to see Bison every week now. I live in Edmonton, so
I&rsquo;m not far from Elk Island where there is a ton of wildish bison roaming
around. I&rsquo;ve literally run into them on the trail. Anyways, they are quite
impressive animals, and I wanted to learn more about them. I found a great
book, <strong>American Bison</strong> by <em>Steven Rinella</em>, which goes into their
history. A lot of the focus is on hunting, but hunting in a humane way
which is really interesting to learn about. Its a very respectful book
about the bison with lots of great information.<h2 id=magical-horror-realism>Magical horror realism</h2><p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this was a genre, but once I found it I realized it was
something that I really enjoyed. <strong>Library at Mount Char</strong> by <em>Scott
Hawkins</em> is my second-favorite book of
2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre
way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to
science fiction.<p>Another thrilling book I read was <strong>Weaveworld</strong> by <em>Clive Barker</em>, an
epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they
merge at the end. Great read. I actually found the previous book after
reading this book and trying to find another book that matched it, to
which I wrote <a href=https://rpiai.com/why-i-made-a-book-recommendation-service/>an entire
program</a>
which ended up becoming a website for people:
<a href=https://www.booksuggestions.ninja>booksuggestions.ninja</a>.<h2 id=fictional-non-fiction>Fictional non-fiction</h2><p>The first book I read of 2017 was <strong>Pieces of the Left Hand</strong> by <em>J.
Robert Lennon</em> and it is a little work of genius. They are a collection of
very, very short tales of a seemingly non-fictional account of the
author&rsquo;s life. The stories of very mundane things - stories about the
locals smashing mailboxes and dinner parties. Except they inexplicably
almost always take a weird and unbelievable end.<p>I have a soft spot for nonconformist writers like Bukowski and Hunter
Thompson. I found <strong>Gonzo Girl</strong> by <em>Cheryl Della Pietra</em> to be an
extraordinary fictional account of an assistant to Hunter Thompson. A lot
of it delves into tropes about genius (drug addition is a trope that it
seems to try to destroy) and sexism (which the author herself constantly
proclaims and then falls right into). Still, the writing is very good.<p><strong>Imaginary Imagnitude</strong> by <em>Stainslaw Lem</em> is a wholly amazing book
- from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of
books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that
communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is
still funny nevertheless.<h2 id=epistemological-articles>Epistemological articles</h2><p>One author has been sticking out to me this year
- <em>Kathryn Schultz</em>. Whenever I read her articles I instantly realize its
her - she has an amazing knack for taking any kind of thesis and detailing
a complete and thoughtful story around it. She seems to like to take
strange thesis too. The first one I read was on <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum>Henry Thoreau as
a hypocrite</a> (of
which I totally disagree but love the writing). My favorite from this year
were <strong><a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/how-to-be-a-know-it-all>How to be
a know-it-all</a></strong>
which posits that its easy to learn a little bit about everything and
<strong><a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/06/is-bigfoot-likelier-than-the-loch-ness-monster>Fantastic beasts and how to rank
them</a></strong>
which tries to understand why its possible to make judgements about things
that don&rsquo;t exist.<p>Another illuminating story was one in <em>The Sun</em>, an interview with ?<h2 id=other-books>Other books</h2><ul><li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong> by <em>Liu Cixin</em><li><strong>Calculating God</strong> by <em>Robert J.
