Unfortunately, since sarcasm is a close friend to cynicism, this can make the Internet a negative and disillusioning place. I decided to make an effort to make a place on the Internet that is more positive and reflective. This place would be where you can present your own story, anonymously and sincerely. The result was initially called &amp;ldquo;Stories, Incognito&amp;rdquo; but I later decided on the name &amp;ldquo;anonfiction&amp;rdquo; (i.</description></item><item><title>Podcasts I heard (2017)</title><link>https://yakczar.com/podcasts-2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:41:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/podcasts-2017/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent days sitting in a dark room looking into a microscope. Lots of the time I listen to music, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to listen to podcasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a lot of great podcasts out there. I think my number one category of podcast is “the podcast about the small things.” Its always a welcome relief from the mainstream media which focuses more on the hyperbole of small things. I do like some news, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found some great podcasts that pitch the news in a more informal and friendly way.</description></item><item><title>Books I read (2017)</title><link>https://yakczar.com/books-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 09:41:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/books-2017/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read about 15 books this year - not as many as I&amp;rsquo;d like (I read 40 in college), but I did a lot of magazine reading too (e.g. The Sun and The New Yorker). The books that I read can be classified into three major categories: non-fictional animal encounters, magical horror realism and fictional non-fiction.
The first main category are books I read in 2017 are about non-fictional animal encounters.</description></item><item><title>Painting from computer-generated primitives</title><link>https://yakczar.com/painting-primitives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 18:25:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/painting-primitives/</guid><description>Computers can do many amazing things with art, especially with the advent of neural networks1. In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was a rendition of photos in primitives. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example (For much more, just follow @primitivepic):
These kinds of photos were generated using a computer program that tries to replicate a photo by slowly building up primitive shapes (ellipses, rectangles, triangles) of a single color until eventually enough different shapes and colors converge on the original image.</description></item><item><title>Odd one out</title><link>https://yakczar.com/odd-one-out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 12:01:10 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/odd-one-out/</guid><description>Being the &amp;ldquo;odd one out&amp;rdquo; means that you differ from all other people in some way. Its pretty easy to feel like the the odd one out in your family. Lots of families might have the one child who is left-handed, or the father who converted to Christianity. Its also easy to feel like the odd one out in your community.

It can do simple things, like generating site maps. It can also do complicated things, like extracting all the quotes from every page on a quotes website (tutorial follows).
Install First get Docker which will be used for running Redis.
Then you can simply download crawdad:

Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.

If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Beware of the free trial</title><link>https://yakczar.com/beware-of-the-free-trial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:51:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/beware-of-the-free-trial/</guid><description>I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong.

For the most part, proteins in the body are crucial for catalyzing reactions that carry out almost all of our biologial processes. For a protein to be useful, after it&amp;rsquo;s made by a ribosome, it needs to fold into a 3-dimensional structure that is unique to its sequence.
Its been widely thought that every unique sequence corresponds to a single unique structure.

However, different animals can understand language on different levels, as noted by Steven Pinker in his book The Language Instinct:
The most receptive trainee for an artificial language with a syntax and semantics has been a parrot; the species with the best claim to recursive structure in its signaling has been the starling; the best vocal imitators are birds and dolphins; and when it comes to reading human intentions, chimps are bested by man&amp;rsquo;s best friend, Canis familiaris.</description></item><item><title>Protein folding, simulation vs. experiment</title><link>https://yakczar.com/simulation-and-experiment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yakczar.com/simulation-and-experiment/</guid><description>Prigozhin et al. has brought simulations and experiments of protein dynamics closer together than ever before.
