      <title>OSS divisions</title>

      <description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS):
1. If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits.
While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description>

      <description>tldr: A big company billed me for years without my knowledge. However, they unknowingly violated their own Conditions of Use so I got my money refunded
I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong. I had a charge of \$15 for The Service (a big company that I will not name here), a service I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used for years after I tried one of their free items.</description>

      <description>This quote by Oscar Wilde,
 &amp;ldquo;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&amp;rdquo;,
 is wrong.
By doing everything in moderation &amp;ndash; including moderation &amp;ndash; then that means you are overdoing moderation, which the quote forbids.
It should be amended:
 &amp;ldquo;Everything in moderation, excepting moderation.&amp;rdquo;

      <title>Open letter to Duke P&amp;T</title>

      <description>Dear Parking &amp;amp; Transportation,
I am writing to you about my experience as a Duke bike-commuter for the past six years. To preface, I have been a bike commuter, in total, for 15 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve commuted between home and school and work in all the places I&amp;rsquo;ve lived - Seattle, New York, and Durham - about 3&amp;ndash;6 miles every day. Unfortunately, I think the most unsafe place I&amp;rsquo;ve biked is within the Duke University campus.</description>
