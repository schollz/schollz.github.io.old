In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was a rendition of photos in primitives. Here&rsquo;s an example (For much more, just <a href=https://twitter.com/PrimitivePic>follow @primitivepic</a>):<p><a href=https://twitter.com/PrimitivePic/status/938243428130926593><img src=/img/bird_primitive.jpg alt="200 triangles."></a><p>These kinds of photos were generated using a computer program that tries to replicate a photo by slowly building up primitive shapes (ellipses, rectangles, triangles) of a single color until eventually enough different shapes and colors converge on the original image. The program is available for free at <a href=https://github.com/fogleman/primitive>github.com/fogleman/primitive</a>.<p>I played around with this program and soon found myself inspired and wanting to learn acrylic painting to paint in that style. I&rsquo;ve never painted in acrylic before (<a href=/watercolor>previously I&rsquo;ve done only watercolor / gouache</a>), but I thought I could learn do better than this computer program. So, in September 2016, I sought to become an artist using this computer program as the teacher.<p><img src=/img/bison_sergioboccardo_shutterstock3.jpg alt="Stock image of Bison I chose to use"><p>I started out trying to take a photo and paint primitives. The photo I chose was of a bison.<p><img src=/img/bison_primitives.gif alt="Primitive procedure generated"><p>I plugged this photo into the program and generated about 100 images that each added a single rectangle onto a base image. This was my guide, and all I had to do was follow the painting procedure from looking at the next image.<p><img src=/img/bison20160926.jpg alt="“First Bison” - acrylic on canvas, September 2016"><p>My first painting follows exactly the primitive style using only rectangles. It remains one of my favorites though it is quite amateur. I misjudged a lot of the colors so everything became a lot brighter. I still struggle with creating subtle colors today, too.<h2 id=moving-towards-to-realism>Moving towards to realism</h2><p>I continued painting throughout the end of 2016 and now into 2017. I&rsquo;ve been painting mostly animals and lots of bison for some reason. One of my New Year Resolutions was to paint every week. I have been able to do that, mostly.<p>I learned a lot painting every week. I followed the advice of <a href=https://www.jessiedoyleart.com/>Jessie Doyle</a> and learned to paint <em>what I see</em> instead of trying to paint <em>what I think I see</em>. I took a class with <a href=http://www.frankhaddock.com/Home.html>Frank Haddock</a> and learned about how to subdue colors (just consider RGB and remove the current color and mix the remaining with white to make a subduing version) and how to use brushes (use filbert for lines).<p><img src=/img/bison20170701.jpg alt="“Bison” - acrylic on canvas, July 2017"><p>I became enamored with the wet-on-wet acrylic because you could get blends of color and strokes. I also found that the primitives were too mechanical to get colors and I experimented with something more realistic.<h2 id=back-to-primitives>Back to primitives</h2><p>Now, at the end of 2017, I&rsquo;ve gone back to the using primitives, but without the restrictions on a particular shape of stroke. Instead, I focus on generating the painting in a few explicit strokes with a wide brush.<p>There is something wonderful about rendering the painting in a few strokes, in a primitive style. In principle it is simple - there are only a few strokes involved. However in practice it is complex - each stroke needs a color, a position and an orientation. There are many combinations for those three options and they have widely different aesthetic appeals. Suddenly determining the next stroke becomes difficult and possibly frusturating. However, I find the result quite appealing.<p><img src=/img/bison20171202.jpg alt="“Bison” - acrylic on canvas, December 2017"><p>Using the idea of primitives and improving upon my ability to draw and paint, I&rsquo;m now able to generate an acrylic painting that is much more satisfying to me in terms of primitives. For the record, I can also paint things other than bison, like birds<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:bird><a rel=footnote href=#fn:bird>2</a></sup> <sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:bird2><a rel=footnote href=#fn:bird2>3</a></sup>.<p>You&rsquo;ve read to the end of this! Wow. As a bonus, here are two painting tips that I would share as a still progressing novice:<ul><li>A nice trick I&rsquo;ve found is to <em>start with a red canvas</em> because it gives a great boldness to the underlying strokes that you don&rsquo;t get with a white canvas.<li>A lot of painting is overcoming frustration. Almost every painting here became extremely frustrating and infuriating to me at some point, but I was always able to work through and eventually like and love the result.</ul><div class=footnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:deep>For some neat examples about neural networks and art, check out my <a href=/watercolor/>previous blog post</a>.
