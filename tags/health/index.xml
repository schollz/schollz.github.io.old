      <description>Cataracts are the clouding of the lens in the eye which can lead to blindness or can severely impair sight. Cataracts are most commonly associated with age, but there are about 20 million people on Earth that were born with cataracts. The cause of these congenital cataracts are varied but most suggest that its the crystallin proteins themselves that get mutated. (1) The eye produces these crystallin proteins that are supposed to last a lifetime, so when they are mutated they become unstable and cause cataracts!</description>

      <title>How can potential transplant donors be identified by their sense of smell?</title>

      <description>Researchers discover a new way of discovering bone marrow transplants matches by using only their sense of smell! I just recently wrote about a recent discovery that find people can smell without their noses (hint they use their skin) . Well, a new article by Lavi Secundo et. al. finds that the nose is still useful, since the olfactory receptors in a nose are so unique that they can distinguish humans from one another and this distinction can be used to find bone marrow transplant donors!</description>

      <title>How do worms help to describe human mortality?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very bold to invent a new word. Its even more bold to invent a new word and add that as a keyword of your science article! That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Ankita Bansala, Lihua Zhua, Kelvin Yena, and Heidi Tissenbaumam did in their paper1 on which they question the value of the term &amp;ldquo;lifespan&amp;rdquo; and probe key assumptions using worms. Their newly invented term, gerospan, shows up about 34 times and, though they don&amp;rsquo;t say exactly where it comes from, it seems to be a mashup of the more common &amp;ldquo;lifespan&amp;rdquo; with the department of one of the authors (Gerontology, which means - literally - the study of old people).</description>
