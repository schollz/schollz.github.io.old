As part of this, I made a Docker image that utilizes Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s readability package.
You can easily use the Docker image to directly read articles from the command line.
First pull it.
$ docker pull schollz/readable Then set a URL that contains a news article:
$ URL=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/world/nobel-physics-prize-2017/index.html Then read!
$ docker run --rm -t schollz/readable $URL | more ---------------------------------------------------------- Nobel Prize in Physics goes to &#39;black hole telescope&#39; trio ---------------------------------------------------------- Story highlights - The development proves Einstein&#39;s prediction of gravitational waves - More than 1,000 people worked on the technology over four decades (CNN)The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry C.</description></item><item><title>Easily captioning images from Markdown</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/captioning-images/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:55:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/captioning-images/</guid><description>Here is a nice trick for captioning images with only alt tags. This is useful when using Markdown to generate HTML pages, since Markdown in its natural form only includes creates an image tag, i.e. ![alt tag](img src) -&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;alt tag&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;img src&amp;quot;&amp;gt;. For good captions, we need to add a figcaption and wrap both inside a figure.
Turns out this is easily done with Javascript to generate figure captions on the load of the page.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS):
1. If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits.
While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Using Wordpress with Docker</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/wordpress-on-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 13:54:51 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/wordpress-on-docker/</guid><description>I like wordpress, but it is very intensive to get working, as it uses a lot of PHP and requires SQL. Of course, nowadays you can do everything in Docker, so here is my method for getting wordpress to work great on Docker.
Using Docker, I was able to get 2 blogs run on the smallest DigitalOcean droplet (which was already running two dozen other things). Each blog required 360MB of RAM, and the total Docker space was 3.</description></item><item><title>Downloading sounds from the JS-8</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/js8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2015 13:54:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/js8/</guid><description>Boss makes a really cool Audio player with guitar effects, the JS-8. It turns out that some of the cool sounds that is has can be downloaded directly via a little hacking. ​ ​ You&amp;rsquo;ll need to create a fake JS-8 device. To do this you basically download the backup data and then format a thumbdrive so that it looks like a JS-8 device.
First download eBand JS-8 factory installed data in the included SD Card.</description></item></channel></rss>
