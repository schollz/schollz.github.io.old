In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was a rendition of photos in primitives, and it made me want to learn to paint in that style. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a painter, I thought I could do better than this computer program. So, in September 2016, I sought to become an artist using a computer as a teacher and started painting in acrylic.</description></item><item><title>What we say has never been said</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/words/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:16:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/words/</guid><description>All that humans has ever been written on the internet is not a million monkeys typing on a keyboard (although a million monkeys typing on a keyboard could produce all the current content),1 with exception of a website that generates random text.2 Still, it seems that the current 25 billion or so webpages3 do not yet contain the sum of all possible thoughts. Its interesting to see how fast the number drops for possible matches on a sentence as the sentence gets longer and longer.</description></item><item><title>Use social media without being social</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</guid><description>Social media seems to be more about creating a persona that voicing your thoughts and ideas. Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS).
If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Beware of the free trial</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:51:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</guid><description>I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong. I had a charge of $15 for The Service (a big company that I will not name here), a service I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used for years after I tried one of their free items. Did I cancel it? No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. But also, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember actually signing up for it.
It got worse. Looking back at my previous statements I saw that I was also charged the previous month as well.</description></item><item><title>Moderation</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 09:43:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</guid><description>This quote by Oscar Wilde,
Everything in moderation, including moderation
is wrong.
By doing everything in moderation &amp;ndash; including moderation &amp;ndash; then that means you are overdoing moderation, which the quote forbids.
It should be amended:
Everything in moderation, excepting moderation</description></item></channel></rss>
