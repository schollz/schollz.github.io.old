This question can be answered by looking at a huge corpora of indexed sentences, e.g. the text of the internet. All that has been written on the internet is not nessecarily a million monkeys typing on a keyboard (although a million monkeys typing on a keyboard could produce all the current content),1 with exception of a website that generates random text.</description></item><item><title>Use social media without being social</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</guid><description>Social media seems to be more about creating a persona that voicing your thoughts and ideas. Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS).
If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Beware of the free trial</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:51:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</guid><description>I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong. I had a charge of $15 for The Service (a big company that I will not name here), a service I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used for years after I tried one of their free items. Did I cancel it? No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. But also, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember actually signing up for it.
It got worse. Looking back at my previous statements I saw that I was also charged the previous month as well.</description></item><item><title>Moderation</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 09:43:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</guid><description>This quote by Oscar Wilde,
Everything in moderation, including moderation
is wrong.
By doing everything in moderation &amp;ndash; including moderation &amp;ndash; then that means you are overdoing moderation, which the quote forbids.
It should be amended:
Everything in moderation, excepting moderation</description></item></channel></rss>
