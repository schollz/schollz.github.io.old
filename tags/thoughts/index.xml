Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of the New Yorker which takes up quite a bit of my reading time.
Illumination in the Flatwoods by Joe Hutto is my favorite book of 2017. I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book.</description></item><item><title>Favorite music of 2017</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/music-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2017 09:41:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/music-2017/</guid><description>I have been using Spotify Discovery Weekly playlists, Sound Opinions podcast, and the NPR All Songs Considered podcast to discover all sorts of great music.
Orchestral Variations by Minor Victories
From what I understand, this is a symphonic cover album of a indie rock album. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to the rock album a little and I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why this orchestral version is so much better.

The basic premise is always to find some small thing that no one thinks about and talk about it for 20-30 minutes and often interview the main players involved in the production of the Small Thing. I think the major bastion of this type of podcast is 99% invisible, which is devoted to illuminating &amp;ldquo;all the thought that goes into the things we donâ€™t think about.</description></item><item><title>What we say has never been said</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/words/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:16:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/words/</guid><description>All that humans has ever been written on the internet is not a million monkeys typing on a keyboard (although a million monkeys typing on a keyboard could produce all the current content),1 with exception of a website that generates random text.2 Still, it seems that the current 25 billion or so webpages3 do not yet contain the sum of all possible thoughts. Its interesting to see how fast the number drops for possible matches on a sentence as the sentence gets longer and longer.</description></item><item><title>Use social media without being social</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/using-social-media/</guid><description>Social media seems to be more about creating a persona that voicing your thoughts and ideas. Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS).
If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Beware of the free trial</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:51:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/beware-of-the-free-trial/</guid><description>I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong. I had a charge of $15 for The Service (a big company that I will not name here), a service I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used for years after I tried one of their free items. Did I cancel it? No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. But also, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember actually signing up for it.
It got worse. Looking back at my previous statements I saw that I was also charged the previous month as well.</description></item><item><title>Moderation</title><link>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 09:43:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://schollz.github.io/moderation/</guid><description>This quote by Oscar Wilde,
Everything in moderation, including moderation
is wrong.
By doing everything in moderation &amp;ndash; including moderation &amp;ndash; then that means you are overdoing moderation, which the quote forbids.
It should be amended:
